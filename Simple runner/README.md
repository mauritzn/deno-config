# Simple Deno runner

This is a simple concept running built using Deno *(TypeScript)*. On Linux you can easily run it using `run.sh`, if you can't use the run file, then run it manually using: `deno run --allow-read --allow-run ./runner.ts`

Permission handling is working well, but currently there is no way to save the selected choice.

The code needs to refactored quite a bit, but the priority was to make sure everything would work.
